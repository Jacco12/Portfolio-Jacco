        <h3 class="myexp-subheader">2019 - 2022</h3>
        <p class="myexp-text">I studied for graphic Deisgner at the RocvA ( Roc van Amsterdam) where  graduated at 2022.
            I learned a lot about design and the adobe programs and I'm happy that I have these skills in adobe.

        <h3 class="myexp-subheader-right">2020 - 2021</h3>
        <p class="myexp-text-right"> During my second year at RocvA I had 2 intership periods, both I had spend at Foodticket because I was learning so much there,
            and I felt like I could get a lot out of it. At Foodticket I mainly worked in Photoshop, this is why I have the most experience
            in this program.

        <h3 class="myexp-subheader">2023 - ongoing</h3>
        <p class="myexp-text">I decided to continue studying becuase I felt that there was more I needed to learn and I wanted to keep studying. I chose this study
            because it's broad with the options you have at the end. You can choose to be a software developer, Graphic designer or even a UX designer.
            I learned to code and I learned that I really enjoy it (if it goes well) I want to learn more about it and get better.
